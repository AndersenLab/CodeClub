# CodeClub Review

This repo is intended to contain relevant files from weekly code club meetings. Over time, it may be appropriate to reorganize by topic rather than week to be as useful as possible.

This code club covered the basics of __GIT__ and __BASH__.

	* `Getting Started with the Command Line.pdf` - A very basic introduction to the commandline.
	* `commandline.sh` - contains a number of ways bash can be used to accomplish data oriented tasks.
	* `GitCheatSheet.md` - Contains information on various git commands.
	* `sync_profile.txt` - An example of a number of commands that would be useful for incorporating into a `.bash_profile`; in this case, this file is used to sync a `.bash_profile` using dropbox.
