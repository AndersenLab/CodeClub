# Define the variables
x <- 5

# Then execute the lines of f() one by one
repx <- g(x, y)

df <- data.frame(x = repx, y = y)

# Now we have to start the process all over again:
num <- x
vec <- y

# And execute line by line
numlist <- list()

i <- 1

while(i < length(vec)) {
    numlist <- append(numlist, num)

# Enter the debugging tools
